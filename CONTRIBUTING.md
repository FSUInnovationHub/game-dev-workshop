# Contributing

First of all, _thank you_ for taking the time to consider contributing to this workshop!  I'm not expecting anything big, if all you do is review code in a pull request, leave feedback in #3, or open an issue, you are a hero by me, especially if you had an issue particular to your browser or operating system.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Help Wanted

If you spot a bug, please flag it in an issue and feel free to open a pull request to squash it; however, make sure to report what branch or version had the bug, and report important information like:
- your browser
- operating system
- slide # (if applicable)
Make sure to leave a clear and descriptive title using the present tense and imperative mood.  For example `Ensure compatibility with Windows & Mac for all commands shown`.  Do not end issue titles with a period, and only capitalize the first word except when referencing proper nouns or case-sensitive code.

If you have a question, feel free to open an issue, but please check to see if your question has already been answered in another issue.  (Don't forget to search through closed issues too.)

## The Ground Rules

1. Respect everyone's time as you respect your own
2. Discuss ideas transparently and respectfully in issues
3. Follow the code of conduct.

## Style Guide

- Use the present tense (`Add feature` not `Added feature`)
- Use the imperative mood (`Move cursor to...` not `Moves cursor to...`)
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally
- Please do not use emoji in commit messages
- Reference code in markdown syntax
- Start commits that only change documentation with [Doc]

## Your First Contribution

Go through the presentation and leave feedback!  It's very helpful to me, and I would like to do everything I can to improve my presentation for future victims.

Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:!  This repository is a Git & GitHub workshop after all.
